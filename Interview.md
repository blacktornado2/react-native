## 1. What are the main differences between React Native and ReactJS?

**Answer:**  
React Native and ReactJS are both frameworks developed by Facebook, but they serve different purposes:

- **ReactJS** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render UI components in the browser.
- **React Native** is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Instead of rendering to the browser DOM, React Native renders to native platform components (iOS and Android), providing a more native look and feel.

**Key Differences:**
- **Rendering:** ReactJS renders web components (DOM), while React Native renders native mobile components.
- **Styling:** ReactJS uses CSS, whereas React Native uses JavaScript-based stylesheets.
- **Platform APIs:** React Native provides access to native device APIs (camera, location, etc.), while ReactJS relies on browser APIs.
- **Navigation:** ReactJS uses libraries like React Router for web navigation; React Native uses libraries like React Navigation for mobile navigation.
- **Deployment:** ReactJS apps run in browsers; React Native apps are compiled into native mobile apps.
